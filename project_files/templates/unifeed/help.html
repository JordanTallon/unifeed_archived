        <h3 class="fw-bold"  id="adding-a-new-folder">Adding a New Folder</h3>
        <p>
            Folders in UniFeed allow you to personalize your experience by organizing your news feeds into different interests, categories or subjects.
        </p>
        <p>
            They are an essential feature of UniFeed as all feeds must be contained within a folder. If you wish to skip the organization benefits, you can simply create an <strong>All</strong> or <strong>Uncategorized</strong> folder to put all of your feeds into.
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="{% static 'attachments/add_new_folder_navigation.png' %}"

        </p>
        <p>
            You can create a folder by selecting the <strong>Add New Folder</strong> option at the bottom of the <strong>My Folders</strong> section of the side navigation. Additionally, there may be contextual <strong>Add New Folder</strong> buttons to help guide you as indicated by the blue arrow.
        </p>
        <p>
            After selecting the <strong>Add New Folder</strong> button you will be presented with a short form. You need only to enter a name for the folder and click the <strong>Save</strong> button to proceed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please note that each folder name must be less than 19 characters and unique. You can change the name of your folder at a later point.

        <p>
            When adding a new feed, you must first select the folder that the newly added feed will belong to. Afterwards, you can begin adding a new feed by either clicking on the <strong>Add New Feed</strong> button at the bottom of the current folder in the side bar, or by clicking the option presented in the <strong>Manage Folder</strong> drop down.

            Once you are on the <strong>Add New Feed</strong> page, you have two choices:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                You may add a feed using a URL link. This allows you to import the RSS feed from any news website that you find on the internet. To find RSS feeds, you must browse your desired news websites or search on Google for public feeds.
            </li>
            <li>
                You can add a feed from a list of pre-existing feeds on the UniFeed website. These are feeds that were imported by other users or the site administrators. This allows you to quickly bring in an RSS feed without having to search for the RSS URL.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>For demonstration, I will use the URL option to add the Irish Times RSS feed which can be found at:</p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/arc/outboundfeeds/feed-irish-news/?from=0&amp;size=20">https://www.irishtimes.com/arc/outboundfeeds/feed-irish-news/?from=0&amp;size=20</a>

        </p>
        <p>
            Simply paste the URL into the URL field and click <strong>Add</strong>.

        <p>Once the new RSS feed is imported, you will be redirected to view the article contents of the feed.</p>
        <p>
            Congratulations you have successfully added a new RSS feed. Please note that feeds only need to be imported once. UniFeed will automatically keep track of the feeds and provide you their latest articles.

        <h4 class="mt-3 pt-3"  id="my-feed">My Feed</h4>
        <p>
            The My Feed page prevents you with a news feed containing articles from all of your imported feeds across all folders. This page is very powerful and allows you to keep up to date with potentially 100s of news sources in a single view.
        </p>
        <p>
            You do not need to do anything to add feeds to <strong>My Feed</strong>. All feeds you import are automatically brought in. If you do not wish to use the Folder feature, you can use the <strong>My Feed</strong> page to make use of UniFeed&#39;s aggregation.
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="{% static 'attachments/my_feed.png' %}"

                 alt="my_feed">
        </p>
        <p>
            As seen in the screenshot, the <strong>My Feed</strong> page contains articles from both the <strong>My Folder</strong> and <strong>American</strong> feeds, all in a single view.
        </p>

        <h4 class="mt-3 pt-3"  id="viewing-an-individual-folder-feed">Viewing an Individual Folder Feed</h4>
        <p>
            To view your feed in isolation, you may click the <strong>View</strong> button in the <strong>Manage Feeds</strong> side panel. This allows you to view the feed on its lonesome without the aggregation feature of the folder.
        </p>

            <img src="{% static 'attachments/manage_feeds_view.png' %}"

                 alt="manage_feeds_view">
        </p>
        <p>Additionally, you can use the left navigation sidebar to view each feed individually.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="{% static 'attachments/view_feed.png' %}"
                 width="auto"

        </p>
        <h4 class="mt-3 pt-3"  id="viewing-an-aggregated-folder-feed">Viewing an Aggregated Folder Feed</h4>
        <p>
            Aggregated feeds are one of the core features of UniFeed. It its a very powerful feature, especially when combined with folders to create multiple different aggregated feeds. For example you could have a &quot;Space&quot; folder containing the RSS feed of both NASA and SpaceX , allowing you to see their articles together. You could then have another feed called &quot;Nature&quot; where you keep up with both &quot;National Geographic&quot; and &quot;Animal Planet&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            To view all feeds within a folder at once, simply click on the folder name, in this case <strong>My Folder</strong> in the side navigation panel.
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="{% static 'attachments/feed_aggregate.png' %}"

                 alt="feed_aggregate">
        </p>
        <p>
            As seen by the red and blue arrows, the <strong>My Folder</strong> feed contains both Irish Times and Fox News articles together, sorted by most recently published.

        <p>
            To begin detecting the political bias of an article, click into the article and then click on the <strong>Detect Political Bias</strong> button under A.I tools on the right hand side.

        </p>
        <p>
            After you click the button, UniFeed will begin analysing the article for bias. The A.I tools section will display a loading wheel as it waits for UniFeed to finish the analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="{% static 'attachments/ai_analysis_scan.png' %}"

        <h4 class="mt-3 pt-3"  id="viewing-analysis-results">Viewing Analysis Results</h4>
        <p>
            Once the analysis is complete, the results of the analysis will display inside the A.I Tools section with a conclusion of bias detected in the article.
        </p>
        <p>
            There will also be a button allowing you to view a more detailed breakdown of how the results were calculated. To view the breakdown, click on the <strong>View Breakdown</strong> button.
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="{% static 'attachments/ai_analysis_view_breakdown.png' %}"

        <p>
            After clicking on the <strong>View Breakdown</strong> button, a panel containing the political bias of sentences in the article will appear.
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="{% static 'attachments/ai_analysis_breakdown.png' %}"
                 width="auto"

                 alt="ai_analysis_breakdown">
        </p>
        <p>
            The coloured labels around some words represent the type of word detected by the natural language processing. For example, <strong>Truckers for Trump millions</strong> was detected as an organization, and <strong>New Yorkers</strong> as a NORP: Nationalities or religious or political groups.
        </p>
        <p>
            These words are highlighted as entities and adjectives play an important role in how UniFeed detects political bias.
        </p>
        <p>
            The subjectivity and polarity are indicators of sentiment - a personal opinion detected in the sentence. These are also important for UniFeed to detect bias.
