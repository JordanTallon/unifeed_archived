## Managing Your Account

# Adding a New Folder

Folders in UniFeed allow you to personalize your experience by organizing your news feeds into different interests, categories or subjects. 

They are an essential feature of UniFeed as all feeds must be contained within a folder. If you wish to skip the organization benefits, you can simply create an 'All' or 'Uncategorized' folder to put all of your feeds into.

![[Pasted image 20240219202012.png]]

You can create a folder by selecting the 'Add New Folder' option at the bottom of the 'My Folders' section of the side navigation. Additionally, there may be contextual 'Add New Folder' buttons to help guide you as indicated by the blue arrow.

After selecting the 'Add New Folder' button you will be presented with a short form. You need only to enter a name for the folder and click the 'Save' button to proceed. 

Please note that each folder name must be less than 19 characters and unique. You can change the name of your folder at a later point.

![[Pasted image 20240219202310.png]]

Congratulations, you have created your first folder. The form will automatically redirect you to the folder view where you can begin adding feeds to your new folder. 

# Managing Your Folder

To manage your folder, begin by clicking on the 'Manage Folder' dropdown in the top right of your folder view.

![[Pasted image 20240219202653.png]]

The dropdown will present a few different options. For this section, we are primarily concerned with 'Edit Folder' and 'Delete Folder' as indicated by the red arrows in the screenshot.

![[Pasted image 20240219202951.png]]

## Edit Folder

The 'Edit Folder' button brings you to a new page where you can modify the name of your folder. Simply enter a new name for the folder and click save. Please note that the folder name must be less than 19 characters long.

![[Pasted image 20240219203228.png]]

## Delete Folder

The 'Delete Folder' button will present a modal asking you to confirm the deletion of the folder. Please note, as indicated in the modal, that this action is undoable and any customization or feed associations to the folder will be lost.

If you wish to proceed with the deletion, click on the 'Delete' button as indicated by the arrow. Otherwise, you may click the 'Cancel' button or close down the modal to abort the deletion process.

![[Pasted image 20240219203605.png]]

# Adding a New feed

When adding a new feed, you must first select the folder that the newly added feed will belong to. Afterwards, you can begin adding a new feed by either clicking on the 'Add New Feed' button at the bottom of the current folder in the side bar, or by clicking the option presented in the 'Manage Folder' drop down. 

![[Pasted image 20240219203013.png]]

Once you are on the 'Add New Feed' page, you have two choices:
1. You may add a feed using a URL link. This allows you to import the RSS feed from any news website that you find on the internet. To find RSS feeds, you must browse your desired news websites or search on Google for public feeds.
2. You can add a feed from a list of pre-existing feeds on the UniFeed website. These are feeds that were imported by other users or the site administrators. This allows you to quickly bring in an RSS feed without having to search for the RSS URL.

For demonstration, I will use the URL option to add the Irish Times RSS feed which can be found at: https://www.irishtimes.com/arc/outboundfeeds/feed-irish-news/?from=0&size=20 

![[Pasted image 20240219204437.png]]

Simply paste the URL into the URL field and click 'Add'.

![[Pasted image 20240219204732.png]]

Once the new RSS feed is imported, you will be redirected to view the article contents of the feed.

Congratulations you have successfully added a new RSS feed. Please note that feeds only need to be imported once. UniFeed will automatically keep track of the feeds and provide you their latest articles.

# Managing Your Feeds

You may delete imported feeds from your folder, or  customize the default feed settings provided by the publisher such as its name and description. 

To begin managing your feeds, you must first navigate to the folder that they belong to. Once there, you can click on the 'Manage Folder' button in the top right to present a dropdown containing a 'Manage Feeds' button

![[Pasted image 20240219205530.png]]

After clicking on the 'Manage Feeds' button you will be presented with a panel on the right side of the screen containing information and management functions for each Feed within the folder. For each feed, you have two management options: Edit and Delete.
## Editing / Moving a Feed

To edit a feed, click on the 'Edit' button in the 'Manage Feeds' panel of the containing folder. 

![[Pasted image 20240219210131.png]]

You will be presented with a form allowing you to customize the feed settings. You can change the name of the feed, it's description, or move it to a new folder. 

![[Pasted image 20240219210312.png]]

Once you are happy with the new settings, simply click the save button.

![[Pasted image 20240219210546.png]]

## Deleting a Feed

To delete a feed, click on the 'Delete' button in the 'Manage Feeds' panel of the containing folder. 

![[Pasted image 20240219211402.png]]

The 'Delete' button will present a modal asking you to confirm the deletion of the feed. Please note, as indicated in the modal, that this action is undoable and any custom feed settings will be lost.

If you wish to proceed with the deletion, click on the 'Delete' button as indicated by the arrow. Otherwise, you may click the 'Cancel' button or close down the modal to abort the deletion process.

![[Pasted image 20240219211456.png]]

# Your UniFeed

The 'My UniFeed' Section of the side navigation contains three pages: Reading List, Recently Read, and My Feed.

## Reading List

The Reading List page presents different articles that you have saved to your 'Reading List'. This list is for articles that you wish to read at a later date. Please note that you may only save up to 20 articles in the 'Reading List' at a time.

### Adding an Article to Your Reading List

To add an article to your 'Reading List' you must first click into the article. Once you are viewing the article details, you may click on a book icon located at the top right of the article image, as seen in the following screenshot.

![[Pasted image 20240219214227.png]]

### Removing an Article From Your Reading List

Removing an Article from your 'Reading List' is as easy as adding it. You simply need to click the filled in grey book to remove the article from your 'Reading List', as seen in the following screenshot.

![[Pasted image 20240219214111.png]]

### Viewing Your Reading List

To view your reading list, you must click on the 'Reading List' button under 'My UniFeed' in the side navigation panel.

![[Pasted image 20240219214338.png]]

You will be presented with all articles in your reading list sorted to start with the most recently added.

## Recently Read

The Recently Read section keeps track of the articles you have previously read. Please note that you must enable the 'Track History' option in your account settings for the 'Recently Read' feature to be enabled. Your reading history will only contain the last 20 articles you have read.

![[Pasted image 20240219214731.png]]

An article is marked as 'Read' when you click on the 'Read Full Article' button.

![[Pasted image 20240219214806.png]]

### My Feed

The My Feed page prevents you with a news feed containing articles from all of your imported feeds across all folders. This page is very powerful and allows you to keep up to date with potentially 100s of news sources in a single view.

You do not need to do anything to add feeds to 'My Feed'. All feeds you import are automatically brought in. If you do not wish to use the Folder feature, you can use the 'My Feed' page to make use of UniFeed's aggregation.

![[Pasted image 20240219215401.png]]

As seen in the screenshot, the 'My Feed' page contains articles from both the 'My Folder' and 'American' feeds, all in a single view.

# Viewing a folder
## Viewing an Individual feed

To view your feed in isolation, you may click the 'View' button in the 'Manage Feeds' side panel. This allows you to view the feed on its lonesome without the aggregation feature of the folder.

![[Pasted image 20240219205911.png]]

Additionally, you can use the left navigation sidebar to view each feed individually.

![[Pasted image 20240219205931.png]]
## Viewing an Aggregated Feed

 Aggregated feeds are one of the core features of UniFeed. It its a very powerful feature, especially when combined with folders to create multiple different aggregated feeds. For example you could have a "Space" folder containing the RSS feed of both NASA and SpaceX , allowing you to see their articles together. You could then have another feed called "Nature" where you keep up with both "National Geographic" and "Animal Planet"

To view all feeds within a folder at once, simply click on the folder name, in this case 'My Folder' in the side navigation panel. 

![[Pasted image 20240219215537.png]]

As seen by the red and blue arrows, the 'My Folder' feed contains both Irish Times and Fox News articles together, sorted by most recently published.
