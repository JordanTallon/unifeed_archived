Congratulations, you are now ready to start exploring UniFeed.

# Adding a New Folder

Folders in UniFeed allow you to personalize your experience by organizing your news feeds into different interests, categories or subjects. 

They are an essential feature of UniFeed as all feeds must be contained within a folder. If you wish to skip the organization benefits, you can simply create an 'All' or 'Uncategorized' folder to put all of your feeds into.

![[Pasted image 20240219202012.png]]

You can create a folder by selecting the 'Add New Folder' option at the bottom of the 'My Folders' section of the side navigation. Additionally, there may be contextual 'Add New Folder' buttons to help guide you as indicated by the blue arrow.

After selecting the 'Add New Folder' button you will be presented with a short form. You need only to enter a name for the folder and click the 'Save' button to proceed. 

Please note that each folder name must be less than 19 characters and unique. You can change the name of your folder at a later point.

![[Pasted image 20240219202310.png]]

Congratulations, you have created your first folder. The form will automatically redirect you to the folder view where you can begin adding feeds to your new folder. 

# Managing Your Folder

To manage your folder, begin by clicking on the 'Manage Folder' dropdown in the top right of your folder view.

![[Pasted image 20240219202653.png]]

The dropdown will present a few different options. For this section, we are primarily concerned with 'Edit Folder' and 'Delete Folder' as indicated by the red arrows in the screenshot.

![[Pasted image 20240219202951.png]]

## Edit Folder

The 'Edit Folder' button brings you to a new page where you can modify the name of your folder. Simply enter a new name for the folder and click save. Please note that the folder name must be less than 19 characters long.

![[Pasted image 20240219203228.png]]

## Delete Folder

The 'Delete Folder' button will present a modal asking you to confirm the deletion of the folder. Please note, as indicated in the modal, that this action is undoable and any customization or feed associations to the folder will be lost.

If you wish to proceed with the deletion, click on the 'Delete' button as indicated by the arrow. Otherwise, you may click the 'Cancel' button or close down the modal to abort the deletion process.

# Adding a New feed

When adding a new feed, you must first select the folder that the newly added feed will belong to. Afterwards, you can begin adding a new feed by either clicking on the 'Add New Feed' button at the bottom of the current folder in the side bar, or by clicking the option presented in the 'Manage Folder' drop down. 

![[Pasted image 20240219203013.png]]

Once you are on the 'Add New Feed' page, you have two choices:
1. You may add a feed using a URL link. This allows you to import the RSS feed from any news website that you find on the internet. To find RSS feeds, you must browse your desired news websites or search on Google for public feeds.
2. You can add a feed from a list of pre-existing feeds on the UniFeed website. These are feeds that were imported by other users or the site administrators. This allows you to quickly bring in an RSS feed without having to search for the RSS URL.

For demonstration, I will use the URL option to add the Irish Times RSS feed which can be found at: https://www.irishtimes.com/arc/outboundfeeds/feed-irish-news/?from=0&size=20 

![[Pasted image 20240219204437.png]]

Simply paste the URL into the URL field and click 'Add'.

![[Pasted image 20240219204732.png]]

Once the new RSS feed is imported, you will be redirected to view the article contents of the feed.

Congratulations you have successfully added a new RSS feed. Please note that feeds only need to be imported once. UniFeed will automatically keep track of the feeds and provide you their latest articles.

# Managing Your Feeds

You may delete imported feeds from your folder, or  customize the default feed settings provided by the publisher such as its name and description. 

To begin managing your feeds, you must first navigate to the folder that they belong to. Once there, you can click on the 'Manage Folder' button in the top right to present a dropdown containing a 'Manage Feeds' button

![[Pasted image 20240219205530.png]]

After clicking on the 'Manage Feeds' button you will be presented with a panel on the right side of the screen containing information and management functions for each Feed within the folder. For each feed, you have three options: View, Edit, or Delete.

## Viewing a Feed

To view your feed in isolation, you may click the 'View' button in the 'Manage Feeds' side panel. This allows you to view the feed on its lonesome without the aggregation feature of the folder.

![[Pasted image 20240219205911.png]]

Additionally, you can use the left navigation sidebar to view each feed individually.

![[Pasted image 20240219205931.png]]

## Editing a Feed

To edit a feed, click on the 'Edit' button in the 'Manage Feeds' panel of the containing folder. 

![[Pasted image 20240219210131.png]]

You will be presented with a form allowing you to customize the feed settings. You can change the name of the feed, it's description, or move it to a new folder. 

![[Pasted image 20240219210312.png]]

Once you are happy with the new settings, simply click the save button.

![[Pasted image 20240219210546.png]]

## Deleting a Feed

To delete a feed, click on the 'Delete' button in the 'Manage Feeds' panel of the containing folder. 

![[Pasted image 20240219211402.png]]

The 'Delete' button will present a modal asking you to confirm the deletion of the feed. Please note, as indicated in the modal, that this action is undoable and any custom feed settings will be lost.
